       My journey through the tech world hasn't been traditional, but it's been uniquely mine. A few years back, a medical experience illuminated my path. 
       It wasn't just a challenge; it was a catalyst. Recognizing my personal underinvestment in accessibility, I pivoted my focus, determined to create
        digital spaces that genuinely cater to diverse needs. My neurodiverse perspective, fueled by my journey with ADHD and autism, adds a unique dimension
         to my approachâ€”one that places understanding and empathy at the forefront of my design and development endeavors.
<br/><br/>
The intersection of design and accessibility is where I shine, creating digital symphonies that everyone can dance to. So, whether you're here to explore my work, 
collaborate on a project, or just geek out about vintage gear, I'm thrilled to have you join me on this ever-evolving journey.
