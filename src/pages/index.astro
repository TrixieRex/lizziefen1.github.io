Hello!

I'm Lizzie (First name Lisa, but I prefer Lizzie). I'm a Developer & Designer from the Kansas City area. I believe that form and function can co-exist beautifully, and that constantly learning and looking for new ways to make the web a better place for all humans are the best parts of working as a creative in technology.

I thrive when I feel I'm contributing to the greater good, and am most productive when I'm working with others that see passion for creativity and learning, trying new paths, and "failing up" as the wonderful tools for growth that they are.

Please take a few moments to review my work and experience and reach out if you have any questions or would like to schedule a time to talk.

Thank you for your time!
