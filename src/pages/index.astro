       <p>I'm a User Experience Designer and Developer driven by a mission to create
        digital experiences that are as inclusive as they are impactful. With an extensive background in both design and development,
         I specialize in crafting user-centric solutions that seamlessly fuse aesthetics with accessibility. As a neurodiverse individual
          with a unique perspective shaped by my journey, I offer a distinct lens through which
           I approach every project. From pixel-perfect interfaces to comprehensive accessibility implementations, I bring a blend of creativity,
            technical prowess, and a commitment to creating a web that truly leaves no one behind.</p>
